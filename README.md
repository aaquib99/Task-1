Objective : Create a single page web application- with left and right pane. I can copy paste some text in the right side input window. Each line of the multi-line input text (in Hindi or English) should be assigned a line number. If I click on any line, the corresponding line number should be displayed in the left pane as â€œYou are on line no X. The text should be in font size 24, centered, color Blue. If no text is selected- give appropriate messages. Use HTML, CSS, JavaScript.
